# Behavioral Question Set 2

## Tell me a bit about your professional experience in 2-3 minutes.

* This question will allow you to get an initial sense of your peer’s experience.
* Feel free to ask follow-up questions, for instance, can you elaborate a bit more on your experience with [specific technology] or your responsibilities at [company]? You can also use this opportunity to ask the candidate which of their experiences had the greatest impact on them.

## What are you looking for in your next role?

* This is an opportunity to get insight into whether a candidate would be a good culture fit for your company. Is the candidate looking for a company of your size? Do their expectations match the role?

## What’s an example of a difficult problem you solved? Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it.

* Owner vs participant: Many candidates will claim they led a big project or created significant impact, but if you dig deeper, you’ll find that the candidate only played a participatory role or was involved in just one facet of the project. As an interviewer, it’s your role to uncover the truth. Follow-up questions asking about who was involved, what the candidate personally did, and how they did it will help you make an informed decision about the candidate’s true impact.
* Good vs great achievements: Many candidates are good at quantifying their achievements, but you’ll want to know how big of an impact this achievement actually had. Was it a minor success or did it have a significant impact? Were the results due to the candidate’s impact, or would those results have likely occurred without their involvement? You may consider asking follow-up questions here too: try to drill down into the baseline metrics used, such as “What were the projected metrics had you not made this decision?”

## What would your current/previous boss say your biggest strength was?

* This question helps you evaluate how self-aware the candidate is about their personal/professional experience and competencies.
* Encourage the candidate to use a specific example to highlight their answer.

## Give me an example of a time when you had a difference of opinion with a team member. How did you handle that?

* This question is about teamwork and influence. You want to dig into the candidate’s ability to reason and listen to a fellow teammate, navigate a difference of opinion, and ultimately, show how they resolved the disagreement.

## Teach me something you’ve recently learned.

* This question is testing two things: (1) the candidate’s interest in continuous learning and (2) the candidate’s ability to break down a complex subject for a lay audience.
