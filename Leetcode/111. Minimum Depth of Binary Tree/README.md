# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its minimum depth = 2.
