# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle

Given an array A of positive lengths, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with non-zero area, formed from 3 of these lengths.

If it is impossible to form any triangle of non-zero area, return 0.

## Example 1:

```
Input: [2,1,2]
Output: 5
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 0
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: [3,2,3,4]
Output: 10
```

## Example 4:

```
Input: [3,6,2,3]
Output: 8
```

## Note:

* 3 <= A.length <= 10000
* 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
