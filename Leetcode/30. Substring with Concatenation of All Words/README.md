# [30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```

## Solutions

|   Approach  | Time complexity | Space complexity |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [Brute force](solution1.md) | O(N! * (M + S<sup>2</sup> * M)) | O(S + M) |
| [Word counter](solution2.md) | O((S – K) * W) | O(w) |
