# 330. Patching Array

Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
Output: 1 
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
Output: 0
```
