# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

## Note:

* You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Example 1:

```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
