# 243. Shortest Word Distance

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

## Example:

Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

## Note:

You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
