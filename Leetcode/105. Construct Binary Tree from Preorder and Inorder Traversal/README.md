# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Travers

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

## Note:

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Return the following binary tree:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7al
```
