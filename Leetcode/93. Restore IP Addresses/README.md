# 93. Restore IP Addresses

Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers (each integer is between 0 and 255) separated by single points.

## Example:

```
Input: "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]
```
