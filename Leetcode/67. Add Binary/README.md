# 67. Add Binary

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

## Example 1:

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## Constraints:

* Each string consists only of '0' or '1' characters.
* 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
* Each string is either "0" or doesn't contain any leading zero.
