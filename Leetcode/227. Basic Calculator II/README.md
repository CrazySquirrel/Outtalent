# 227. Basic Calculator II

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

## Example 1:

```
Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

## Note:

* You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
* Do not use the eval built-in library function.
