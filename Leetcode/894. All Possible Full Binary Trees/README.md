# 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

## Example 1:

```
Input: 7
Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
