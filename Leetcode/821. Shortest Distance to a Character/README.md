# 821. Shortest Distance to a Character

Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character C in the string.

## Example 1:

```
Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
``` 

## Note:

* S string length is in [1, 10000].
* C is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
* All letters in S and C are lowercase.
