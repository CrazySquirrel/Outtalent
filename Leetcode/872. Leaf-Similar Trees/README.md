# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

## Constraints:

* Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 200 nodes.
* Both of the given trees will have values between 0 and 200
